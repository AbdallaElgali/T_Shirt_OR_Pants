Project Title: T-Shirt or Pants Classifier
Overview
The "T-Shirt or Pants Classifier" is a machine learning project aimed at classifying images of clothing into two categories: t-shirts and pants. The project utilizes image processing techniques and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classification to achieve accurate predictions.

Project Structure
model.py: This script contains the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
test.py: This script provides functions to load the trained model and make predictions on new images.
data: This directory stores the training images categorized into t-shirts and pants.
Test_data: This directory contains images for testing the trained model.
Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language for implementing the machine learning algorithms and image processing techniques.
scikit-learn: Utilized for implementing the SVM classifier and grid search for hyperparameter tuning.
NumPy: Used for numerical computations and handling of arrays.
PIL (Python Imaging Library): Employed for image processing tasks such as resizing and converting images to grayscale.
Joblib: Used for saving and loading the trained SVM model.
Anaconda Distribution: The project environment is managed using Anaconda, ensuring easy package installation and dependency management.
Project Workflow
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Images are loaded from the specified directory, resized to a consistent size, converted to grayscale, and flattened into feature vectors.

Label Encoding: The class labels (t-shirt, pants) are encoded into numerical values using scikit-learn's LabelEncoder.

Model Training: The SVM model is trained using the training data. Grid search is performed to find the optimal hyperparameters for the SVM classifier.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated on the test set to assess its performance in terms of accuracy.

Prediction: The trained model is saved, and functions are provided to load the model and make predictions on new images.

Instructions for Usage
Training: To train the model, run the model.py script. Ensure that the image data directory (input_data) is correctly specified.

Testing: Use the test.py script to load the trained model and make predictions on new images. Provide the path to the image file as input to the predict function.

Results and Performance
The model achieves a high accuracy on the test set, indicating its effectiveness in classifying t-shirts and pants.
